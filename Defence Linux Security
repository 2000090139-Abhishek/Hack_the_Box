ğŸ”¹Firewalls
   A firewall acts as a barrier
   between a trusted internal
   network and untrusted external 
   networks, like the internet. 
  It monitors and controls incoming
  and outgoing network traffic based
  on predetermined security rules.
  By filtering data packets,
  it helps prevent unauthorized access 
  and protects against malicious threats,
  such as hacking and malware.
  Firewalls can be hardware-based,
  software-based, or a combination of
  both, and they are a crucial 
  component of network security 
  strategies.
